# Aqua365

## Problem Statement
California water Board maintains water quality, water bodies, and chemical composition of water resources across California. However, there does not exist an AI based system to analyse and predict water quality based on it's composition.

## Abstract
Through this project we aim to precisely and accurately forecast water quality to encourage better environment for aquatic life. Our project thrives to monitor, visualize and predict water quality index from the given composition. This kind of forecasting is majorly absent in the industries requiring constant monitoring and maintenance of water qaulity index and this project plans to further implement this approach in the controlled breeding of aquatic life, to help regularize and automate the industry.

## Approach
The data is going to be gathered from the source and multiple datasets will be refined and pre-processed. The data will be then stored on IBM cloud and then further will be spliced into training data and test data. Dependencies and relationships between the data will be identified and will be trained using appropriate prediction algorithms. The predictions generated would be presented to the user when a request is made through a GUI.
