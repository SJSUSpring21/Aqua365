## Problem Statement
Public Water Systems (PWS) provides water, recycled water, and wastewater service to thousands people across several cities in California. However, in the recent years the gap between water consumption and water production has increased and droughts have plagued local communities.

## Abstract
Through this project we aim to precisely and accurately forecast water demand to encourage expansion of conservation programs. Our project thrives to bridge the ever increasing gap between water consumption and water production. This kind of demand forecasting is commonly used in the energy sector and this project plans to further implement this approach in the water sector, to help anticipate the upcoming shortages.

## Approach
The data is going to be gathered from the source and multiple datasets will be refined and pre-processed. The data will be then stored on IBM cloud and then further will be spliced into training data and test data. Dependencies and relationships between the data will be identified and will be trained using appropriate prediction algorithms. The predictions generated would be presented to the user when a request is made through a GUI.
